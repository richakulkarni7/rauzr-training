#To-do app using react-redux

1. Run `create-react-app to-do`
2. Install `redux` and `react-redux` modules using `npm install --save <module-name>` in the to-do folder.
3. Replace `src` folder in the created `to-do` with the `src` folder from this repo. (Leave `node_modules`, `public` folders and other files as they are.)
